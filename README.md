This is a Create React App project using [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) for the backend.
The app consists in a pet adoption interface. The first commit is the app working locally and the second is working in a JSON server.
You can add pets by inputting a photo, name, and selecting the kind. After adding them, it's possible to edit the information by clicking on it and to adopt by clicking on the little house and confirming.
